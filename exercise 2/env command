env is used to either print environment variables. It is also used to run a utility or command in a custom environment. In practice, env has another common use. It is often used by shell scripts to launch the correct interpreter. In this usage, the environment is typically not changed.
Options of env command

1. Without any argument : print out a list of all environment variables.
-i or –ignore-environment or only – : runs a command with an empty environment

SYNTAX :

$ env -i your_command
In this, it clears all the environment variable and then new shell sets the environment variable PWD. Thus in this new shell when we execute env, we only see one environment variable PWD.

2. -u or –unset: remove variable from the environment
